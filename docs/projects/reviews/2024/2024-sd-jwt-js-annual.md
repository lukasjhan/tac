## Project Health

This is the reference implementation of [IETF SD-JWT specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/), [IETF SD-JWT VC specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/) and [Token Status List](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-status-list/) in Javascript/Typescript.

This library is for the Selective Disclosure capability which is one of the important building blocks of digital identity wallets.

## Goals

### Performance Against Prior Goals

The project has met its goals for the last year, which were to keep the codebase
up to date with the latest version of the draft and to provide a reference
implementation for the draft.

### Next Year's Goals

- Continuously updated until standards are finalized.
  - SD-JWT
  - SD-JWT VC
  - Token Status List

## Help Required

The project is in good shape and does not require any help at the moment.
